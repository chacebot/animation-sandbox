# Cursor Rules for Animation Sandbox

This file provides guidance to Cursor AI when working with code in this repository.

## Build & Run Commands

This is a Vite React TypeScript application:

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev

# Build for production
npm run build

# Preview production build
npm run preview
```

## Architecture

### Tech Stack
- **React 18** with **TypeScript**
- **Vite** build tool
- No external UI libraries (pure React + CSS)

### Project Structure
- `src/components/` - Animation components and sandbox UI
- `src/App.tsx` - Main app component
- `src/index.css` - Global styles

### Animation Components
All animation components are defined in `AnimationSandbox.tsx`:
- Each component is a functional React component
- Components accept `text` (required) and `speed` (optional) props
- All animations use React hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`) for state management
- CSS animations and keyframes are defined inline or in `<style>` tags

### Patterns
- Self-contained animation components (no external dependencies)
- Reusable and portable - can be copied into any React project
- Dark minimalist theme matching modern design aesthetics

## Workflow Preferences

### Planning & Commits
- For non-trivial changes, propose a short plan (1-6 bullets) describing edits, tests, and files before proceeding
- Apply minimal, focused edits; one atomic commit per logically grouped change
- Use short, descriptive commit messages
- Run build before committing; stop and report failures with suggested fixes
- Create feature branches for changes (e.g., `git checkout -b feature/new-animation`)
- Update README.md when adding new animation types or changing behavior

### Code Quality
- Follow React and TypeScript best practices
- Keep animation components small and focused
- When referencing code, show exact `path/to/file` and function names
- Maintain consistent component prop interfaces
- Use descriptive variable names for animation states

### Adding New Animations
1. Create a new component function in `AnimationSandbox.tsx`
2. Add it to the `animations` array with appropriate category
3. Test the animation in the sandbox
4. Update README.md with the new animation type

## Additional Cursor-Specific Guidelines

- When editing TypeScript/React files, ensure proper indentation and formatting
- Prefer using React's declarative patterns
- When suggesting changes, provide code examples with proper TypeScript and React syntax
- Always verify that code changes compile before suggesting them
- Use type inference where appropriate but be explicit when it improves clarity
- Follow the existing code style and patterns in the codebase
